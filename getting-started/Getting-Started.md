# I'm new to Ethereum Blockchain Development
Welcome, we're glad you've decided to explore the possibilities of developing ontop of the Ethereum Blockchain. On Ethereum you can deploy applications or Smart Contracts which can perform operations and persist state when called. This "transaction" executes and is confirmed on hundreds of different machines all around the world. If you'd like to read more about the Ethereum Blockchain or Blockchains in general, read on here.

Now that you have a basic understanding of what is happening on Ethereum its time to talk about Tokens. Tokens (commonly referred to as ERC20 after their community standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20)) are a simple program (or smart contract) that tracks a balance with an account. You can ask this smart contract to transfer tokens from your balance to anyone else. Others can also ask the smart contract to send you tokens. All of these are transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain and cost a small transaction fee.

The 0x Protocol extends on this simple example by writing a smart contract which performs multiple balance transfers in one operation. If Alice wanted to exchange some amount of TokenA for TokenB with Bob, Alice would only want to do this if Bob had enough tokens. Rather than Alice sending her amount of TokenA to Bob and hoping Bob will send TokenB to Alice, the 0x Protocol performs this as a guaranteed atomic operation. So Alice and Bob will both get exactly what they asked for. The 0x Protocol is designed around minimsing the amount of transactions (and therefor fees) required for Alice and Bob to successfully exchange tokens. We refer to this  as off-chain orders with on-chain settlement. So Alice can make as many Orders as she likes with no transaction fees.

You can find more information on the 0x Protocol from the presentation given at Devcon as well as our whitepaper.

Browsers currently do not natively support interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain or the various dApps that are currently deployed, although Brave Browser is paving the way. In the meantime a browser extension called Metamask provides a stop-gap. Metamask will store the users keys securely and allow them to submit transactions to an Ethereum Node. To interact with dApps the funds must be under the users control, they cannot interact from exchanges like Coinbase. For mobile users there are Apps like Toshi and Cipher browser which provide a great experience. MyEtherWallet provides a good browser based wallet experience, but does not interact with dApps easily, its is better for sending and receiving Eth. 

Testing and Local development is aided by running your own test network. This allows you to quickly and cheaply deploy contracts. TestRPC is the best tool for a local development network. 

The canonical version of Ethereum is called the Main network, but there are a number of test networks available. Namely Kovan, Rinkeby and Ropsten. You can, and we do recommend, run your own local test network called TestRPC. This is best for rapid development. Caution, TestRPC is an approximation and can sometimes behave differently and unexpectedly. The usual development cycle is to graduate from TestRPC to a Test Network like Kovan, and then on to Main network.

It is often difficult to get a bankroll of ETH to begin on these test networks, so we have written a faucet which can dispense a small amount of Eth to your account. Navigate over to the 0x Portal with Metamask installed while you're connected to the Kovan Network and click Request to get started!

Rather than running your own Ethereum Node to connect to a network, many developers utilize INFURA (https://infura.io/) which provides public infrastructure gateway to Ethereum Nodes. You can use these to connect to Main Network and various test networks like Kovan.

By now you are likely familiar with ERC20 tokens and Eth. Unfortunately, Eth is not an ERC20 token and interacting with both ERC20 tokens and ETH at the same time can lead to complex scenarios which adds more complexity to your smart contracts. Less code is better as it is easier to understand and audit. One technique the community has adopted is to adapt the interface of ETH to act like an ERC20 token. This allows one to treat everything as an ERC20 token and reduces smart contract complexity. We call this WETH or Wrapper ETH. The owner of the ETH would deposit, for example, 1ETH into the WETH contract and they would receive back 1 WETH. When they are done with the WETH they withdraw back their 1ETH in exchange for 1 WETH. This idea is becoming increasingly common in the ecosystem and more information on WETH can be found here (https://weth.io/).

Now that you have been given a high level overview of Ethereum Blockchain development and how to get started, you should check out our other tutorials and examples or our code sandbox.
