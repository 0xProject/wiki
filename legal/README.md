Thank you for considering contributing to the [0x Legal Wiki and 0x Legal Library](https://blog.0xproject.com/new-legal-resources-for-the-0x-ecosystem-55044a21a3d2). This document lays out some background behind these resources and instructions for contributing.

### Background

The 0x Legal Wiki and 0x Legal Library are intended as resources for developers building on top of smart contract platforms like Ethereum, and primarily for developers integrating decentralized open financial protocols like the 0x protocol. All contributed content should be written with this intended audience in mind. If you are unfamiliar with such protocols, here are a few resources that can provide you some background:
  - [Letter to CFTC with explanation of 0x](https://blog.0xproject.com/response-to-the-cftc-about-ethereum-and-0x-3c46a94d8915)
  - [Mapping The Decentralized Financial System](https://tokeneconomy.co/mapping-the-decentralized-financial-system-7c5af65e0335)
  - [DeFi Community Page](https://defi.network/)

The purpose of the Wiki is to summarize the law in an objective and clear manner that can be consumed by non-lawyers. The Wiki is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of every potentially applicable law. Rather, it is intended to help non-lawyers spot potential legal issues for further research.

The purpose of the Library is to be a curated list of links that provide the most pertinent and helpful reference materials for someone interested in digging deeper into the issues summarized in the Wiki. The Library is not intended to link to every potentially relevant third party resource.

### Contribution Instructions

We are interested in both revisions to existing sections of the Wiki and Library as well as contributions of new sections covering different laws and jurisdictions.

For revisions, simply follow the instructions for editing the existing documents in this subfolder set forth below. For new sections, please first coordinate with Jason Somensatto to refine your topic and to be grouped with others who may be interested in collaboration on the same section.

  #### GitHub Instructions

The Wiki and Library are maintained on GitHub so that version control can be easily managed. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, it is fairly easy to understand and does not take very much knowledge to use for this project. If you want some background, [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) explains GitHub in fairly simple terms for non-developers, but in summary, here is what you will need to do:
  - If you have not already, sign up for an account at [github.com](http://github.com/)
  - Navigate to the Legal Wiki & Library at 0x's GitHub page. Here is the [direct link](https://github.com/0xProject/wiki/tree/master/legal)
  - You can “Star” or “Watch” the 0x GitHub to make it easier to navigate back assuming you do not have the direct link.
  - Edit the file you want to contribute to using [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-another-users-repository)
    - Save as a draft under “Create Pull Request” if not ready for final review. Your work will be saved until the next time you want to edit.
  - Content must be written in Markdown language, which is just an easy way to format writing. Numerous [simple guides](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) will show you how to add links, bold and italicize phrases, and add headings.
  - When ready for final review, select “Create Pull Request” and the suggested content will be submitted for review by the 0x core team for potential integration.
    - Submissions will be formatted as a “Pull Request (https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)” that the 0x core team can review, comment on, and suggest or add changes.
    - Don't worry - you wont be able to push out any edits directly to the documents. All edits will have to be approved by someone at 0x.
  - Once all edits are made in response to comments on the pull request, the 0x core team will “merge” the pull request into the live code/final documents, and your submissions will become part of the live documents on GitHub and the content will also appear on [0x's wiki page](https://0x.org/wiki).

As mentioned, GitHub allows for comments and discussions about particular substantive changes proposed to the Wiki and Library. However, for broader discussion such as collaboration with the 0x core team and other contributors, we have set up a private channel on the 0x Discord.
